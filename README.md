# rmarkdown-website-tutorial
[Website for COA-606 (Formerly Biometry) "Statistics for Scientists and Engineers"](https://rtleaf.github.io/rtleaf-COA-606-Statistics-for-Scientists-and-Engineers).

To build the website, run [`rmarkdown::render_site()`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html), which knits each Rmarkdown (*.Rmd) based on parameters in `_site.yml` before pushing the files back to Github.
